## Introduction

The IoT RC Car project integrates modern technology with traditional toys. By using the NodeMCU ESP8266, you can control the car from anywhere with an internet connection. This project is perfect for learning about IoT, coding, and electronics.

## Features

- **Wi-Fi Control**: Control your RC car over the internet.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Get real-time status updates from the car.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple wiring and code to get started quickly.
- **Expandable**: Add sensors or cameras for more functionality.

## Components Needed

To build your IoT RC car, you will need the following components:

- **NodeMCU ESP8266**: The brain of your project.
- **RC Car Chassis**: The body of your car.
- **L298N Motor Driver**: To control the motors.
- **DC Motors**: For movement.
- **Battery Pack**: To power the car.
- **Jumper Wires**: For connections.
- **Breadboard**: Optional, for easy wiring.

## Wiring Diagram

Hereâ€™s a simple wiring diagram to help you connect the components:

Make sure to connect the NodeMCU to the L298N motor driver correctly. Refer to the component datasheets for detailed pin configurations.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Code**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/RISHADALI17/iot-rc-car-nodemcu/releases) to download the latest version of the code.
2. **Install the Arduino IDE**: If you haven't already, download and install the Arduino IDE.
3. **Install ESP8266 Board**: Open the Arduino IDE, go to File > Preferences, and add the ESP8266 board URL. Then, go to Tools > Board > Board Manager and install the ESP8266 board.
4. **Upload the Code**: Open the downloaded code in the Arduino IDE. Modify the Wi-Fi credentials in the code. Upload the code to the NodeMCU.
5. **Power Up the Car**: Connect the battery pack to the RC car and power it on.

## Code Overview

The code consists of several key parts:

- **Wi-Fi Setup**: Connects the NodeMCU to your Wi-Fi network.
- **Motor Control Functions**: Functions to control the direction and speed of the car.
- **Web Server**: A simple web server to handle incoming requests from the browser.

Hereâ€™s a brief look at the code structure:

```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

// Wi-Fi credentials
const char* ssid = "your-ssid";
const char* password = "your-password";

// Motor pins
const int motor1A = D1;
const int motor1B = D2;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
    // Set up motor pins
    pinMode(motor1A, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(motor1B, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
    // Handle web server requests
}
```

## How to Run the Project

After completing the setup, you can run the project by following these steps:

1. **Connect to Wi-Fi**: Ensure your NodeMCU is connected to your Wi-Fi network.
2. **Access the Control Page**: Open a web browser and enter the NodeMCU's IP address. You can find the IP address in the Serial Monitor after uploading the code.
3. **Control the Car**: Use the buttons on the web page to control the movement of the car.

For the latest code and updates, you can always check the [Releases section](https://github.com/RISHADALI17/iot-rc-car-nodemcu/releases).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common problems and solutions:

- **Car Does Not Move**: Check the wiring and ensure the motor driver is powered.
- **Wi-Fi Connection Issues**: Verify your Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
- **No Response from Web Page**: Ensure the NodeMCU is powered and connected to the network.
